# Svelto.Tasks
======================

Run Parallel and Serial Promises compliant tasks, even on other threads! Compatible with Unity 5 and onward.

Please read about it on here:

http://www.sebaslab.com/svelto-taskrunner-run-serial-and-parallel-asynchronous-tasks-in-unity3d/

If you want to test it out right away with some pre made examples, please don't download this repository, but instead use this one: https://github.com/sebas77/Svelto.Tasks.Tests

Note: last compiled with Unity 2017. Now compatible with UWP (you must delete the unit tests if you want to build a project from the example). I try to keep the library Unity agnostic, but since I don't test on anything else, it won't probably work out of the box.
